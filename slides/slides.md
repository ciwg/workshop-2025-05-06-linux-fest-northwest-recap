# LinuxFest Northwest 2025 
## Highlights & Reflections

---

# Welcome to LFNW
- First time at LinuxFest Northwest for most attendees
- “Orientation: How to LFNW” repeated across the event
- Gave helpful context and history
- Where to get coffee and food
- My Take: *Super helpful—great for first-timers *

---

# Project Caua
### Start Your Own Business, Be Your Own Boss
- Jon "maddog" Hall
- Helping students in developing countries build businesses using free/open source software & hardware
- Self-directed, mentored, and zero cost
- He focused on Brazil and the Labrador 


**My Take:** *Maddog is always great—his stories are compelling. I even brought up Raspberry Pi tariffs.*

---

# Post-Pandemic Meetups
### Mariatta Wijaya (Python Core Dev)
- Struggles in rebooting local OSS meetups
- PyLadies Vancouver post-COVID challenges
- Offices are gone, layoffs, disconnected networks
- People got so used to doing things online that they stopped going to in person activities

**My Take:** *Disappointing—mostly Vancouver-specific, but I met people from 2 of my groups!*

---

# WASM Workloads on Kubernetes
### Christopher Valerio
- WebAssembly + K8s = lightweight cloud-native apps
- Potential to reshape cloud computing

**My Take:** *Disappointing. Zoom-only, bad lighting, no airflow—watch the YouTube recording instead.*

---

# Credential Management Quest
### Shelby Palmersheim (BitLocker)
- Free tools and resources
- Includes authenticatotor apps, password managers, and more


**My Take:** *Felt like a sales pitch—but honestly, it helped me solve a few personal issues.*

---

# AI, Misinformation & Human Psychology
### Autumn Nash (Microsoft)
- Human error = 95% of cybersecurity incidents
- The era of AI + misinformation needs better education

**My Take:** *Incredible speaker. Large auditorium, yet it felt like a personal conversation.  This turned into a talk about helping people understand basic technology.  For instance, seniors or people on the spectrum*

---

# Community & Connection: The Raffle
- Massive hit
- Created excitement and energy
- Everyone looked forward to it

**My Take:** This is where they did the conference wide announcements, since no real keynote.  *Unexpectedly one of the most engaging parts of the conference!*

---

# Social Dinner & Pub Night
- Sat with new people at dinner—instant friends!
- Many were speakers from over the world.  Sat with people from Puerto Rico, Brazil, and the UK
- Continued bonding at the pub afterward

**My Take:** *Would be great to have singles-friendly zones. Still, I found my group by asking!*

---

# Sunday: Learning Vim
### “Stop Worrying and Love Vim”
- Live demo and Q&A on Vim basics and tips
- Focused, beginner-friendly

**My Take:** *Fantastic. Loved that he gave out slides—could just absorb the talk and learn.*

# Sunday: Web Components 101
### Morgan Murrah
- Intro to Custom Elements in modern browsers
- HTML/CSS/JS-based, real-world examples

**My Take:** *Nice way to wrap up the weekend—plus I met Morgan at dinner the night before!*

---

# Security and the Linux Advantage
### Trey Blalock (Verification Labs)
- Fast-paced, practical, focused on Internet security
- Why Linux stands out in the security landscape
- Almost 100 slides with lots of references.  This was extremely fast paced since it was only an hour.

**My Take:** *Really informative. Specific tips we could adopt—Linux security matters!*

# A Career in Open Source
### Jon “maddog” Hall Again
- His life story: FORTRAN, Unix, Linux, and meeting Linus
- A walk through open source history

**My Take:** *Truly amazing. Insightful and inspiring look at the evolution of Linux.*

# The Power of In-Person
- Many valuable connections made outside talks
- Casual meetups led to deeper insights and collaboration
- Don’t underestimate hallway conversations

# Information Security Talk
## Not on youtube....yet
---

### Map Your “Attack Surface”
- **What it is:** A simple diagram or spreadsheet of every device, service, and third-party part you use.  
- **Why it matters:** Provides a clear overview of potential vulnerabilities, helping teams prioritize where to strengthen defenses.

---

### Show Your Supply Chain Transparency (SBOMs)
- **What it is:** A clear, published list of every library and component inside your product (software and firmware).  
- **Why it matters:** Builds trust and accelerates compliance reviews by making the exact contents of your product easy to verify.  

---

### Offer a Clear “Security Contact” File
- **What it is:** A small `security.txt` text file on your website or device portal that says “Here’s who to contact if you find a vulnerability.”  
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates a commitment to responsible disclosure and ensures reports reach the right people without delay.

---

### Continuous “Health Checks” for Dependencies
- **What it is:** Automated scans that monitor every third-party component for newly discovered vulnerabilities.  
- **Why it matters:** Catches issues as soon as they’re announced, reducing urgent patch cycles and keeping release schedules predictable.

---

### Embed Security Checks into Daily Tools
- **What it is:** Plugins or simple scripts that flag dependency or configuration issues directly within the editors and IDEs your developers already use.  
- **Why it matters:** Integrates security feedback into everyday workflows, making it a seamless part of the development process.
I know we have go vet and go test in Makefile, but is this where that would go?

---

### Standardize Your “Safety Checklist”
- **What it is:** Corporate policies like signed releases, two-factor login for all accounts, and enforced dependency pinning.  
- **Why it matters:** Establishes consistent security guardrails that simplify audits and reinforce best practices across the organization.
