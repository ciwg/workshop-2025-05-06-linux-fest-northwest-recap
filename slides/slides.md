# LinuxFest Northwest 2025: Highlights & Reflections
## A Personal Overview for Our Team

---

# Welcome to LFNW
- First time at LinuxFest Northwest for most attendees
- “Orientation: How to LFNW” repeated across the event
- Gave helpful context and history
- My Take: *Super helpful—great for first-timers like most of us*

---

# Project Caua
### Start Your Own Business, Be Your Own Boss
- Jon "maddog" Hall
- Helping students in developing countries build businesses using free/open source software & hardware
- Self-directed, mentored, and zero cost

**My Take:** *Maddog is always great—his stories are compelling. I even brought up Raspberry Pi tariffs.*

---

# Post-Pandemic Meetups
### Mariatta Wijaya (Python Core Dev)
- Struggles in rebooting local OSS meetups
- PyLadies Vancouver post-COVID challenges
- Offices are gone, layoffs, disconnected networks

**My Take:** *Disappointing—mostly Vancouver-specific, but I met people from my old groups!*

---

# WASM Workloads on Kubernetes
### Christopher Valerio
- WebAssembly + K8s = lightweight cloud-native apps
- Potential to reshape cloud computing

**My Take:** *Disappointing. Zoom-only, bad lighting, no airflow—watch the YouTube recording instead.*

---

# Credential Management Quest
### Shelby Palmersheim (BitLocker)
- Password and credential management strategies
- Tailored to individuals and organizations

**My Take:** *Felt like a sales pitch—but honestly, it helped me solve a few personal issues.*

---

# AI, Misinformation & Human Psychology
### Autumn Nash (Microsoft)
- Human error = 95% of cybersecurity incidents
- The era of AI + misinformation needs better education

**My Take:** *Incredible speaker. Large auditorium, yet it felt like a personal conversation.*

---

# Community & Connection: The Raffle
- Massive hit
- Created excitement and energy
- Everyone looked forward to it

**My Take:** *Unexpectedly one of the most engaging parts of the conference!*

---

# Social Dinner & Pub Night
- Sat with new people at dinner—instant friends!
- Continued bonding at the pub afterward

**My Take:** *Would be great to have singles-friendly zones. Still, I found my group by asking!*

---

# Sunday: Learning Vim
### “Stop Worrying and Love Vim”
- Live demo and Q&A on Vim basics and tips
- Focused, beginner-friendly

**My Take:** *Fantastic. Loved that he gave out slides—could just absorb the talk and learn.*

---

# Sunday: Web Components 101
### Morgan Murrah
- Intro to Custom Elements in modern browsers
- HTML/CSS/JS-based, real-world examples

**My Take:** *Nice way to wrap up the weekend—plus I met Morgan at dinner the night before!*

---

# Security and the Linux Advantage
### Trey Blalock (Verification Labs)
- Fast-paced, practical, focused on Internet security
- Why Linux stands out in the security landscape

**My Take:** *Really informative. Specific tips we could adopt—Linux security matters!*

---

# A Career in Open Source
### Jon “maddog” Hall Again
- His life story: FORTRAN, Unix, Linux, and meeting Linus
- A walk through open source history

**My Take:** *Truly amazing. Insightful and inspiring look at the evolution of Linux.*

---

# Key Observations
- Most talks had a unique personal or community angle
- Not every talk applied directly, but all gave insight into the ecosystem
- Events beyond the talks were just as valuable (raffle, dinner)

---

# The Power of In-Person
- Many valuable connections made outside talks
- Casual meetups led to deeper insights and collaboration
- Don’t underestimate hallway conversations

---

# A Conference for Us
- LinuxFest Northwest isn’t just for experts or devs
- Useful for sysadmins, hobbyists, educators, and everyone in between
- Open Source culture is welcoming and evolving

---

# What Surprised Me
- Talks I expected to love (WASM) fell flat
- Talks I knew little about (Shelby’s, Autumn’s) ended up being highlights
- Community vibe made it all worthwhile

---

# What Could Be Improved
- More interactive elements
- Better venue ventilation/lighting
- More guidance for solo attendees

---

# What We Can Do as a Team
- Share takeaways internally
- Consider hosting local meetups or attending more OSS events
- Start a mini-project inspired by Project Caua or Vim talk

---

# Watch Later: Suggested Talks
- Autumn Nash: AI & Security (must-watch)
- Trey Blalock: Linux & Internet Security
- Jon Hall: “In the Beginning…”

---

# Thank You!
- Let’s keep the LinuxFest energy going
- Questions? Want to discuss a session?
- Let’s chat in the next team sync or over coffee!
